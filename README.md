## About me

I'm a former academic Librarian with years of teaching experience, and plenty of time writing research guides, how-tos, documentation of processes and policies, and other related duties. I also have worked as a freelance graphic designer, and use my design skills and innate sense of balance and clarity to ensure all my work is easy to read, understand, and navigate.
