## About me

I'm a former academic Librarian with years of teaching experience, and plenty of time writing research guides, how-tos, documentation of processes and policies, and other related duties. AS an academic librarian, my job has been teaching college students how to do research, use complex research databases, format documents, print, use a variety of software, and more.

Prior to becoming a librarian, I have worked as an academic program manager and a freelance graphic designer, and use my project management skills and design expertise in current projects. Some of my samples represent versions of past projects that are internal documentation and therefore not available publically, while others reference projects I've conducted as a librarian.
